# Worlds {#worlds}

Not a literal world, rather it refers to an opaque process or mechanism that is:
- Embedded within a larger system or exist alone.
- Produces an output or moves into a state that is of interest.

The _'world'_, more precisely the world's _output_ or _state_ is the subject of a model. The quality of 
this model rest completely on its ability to **replicate** and **explain** the outputs or states of interest.
- A model's goal can be achieved by directly mapping and reflecting the elements of the real world.
_**OR**_
- A model's goal can be achieved by totally abstracting the elements of the real world.
