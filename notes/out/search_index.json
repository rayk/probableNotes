The quality of this model rest completely on its ability to replicate and explain the outputs or states of interest. - A model’s goal can be achieved by directly mapping and reflecting the elements of the real world. OR - A model’s goal can be achieved by totally abstracting the elements of the real world. 2.1 Small Close Worlds 2.2 Large Open Worlds 2.3 Moving Between Worlds "],["opacity.html", "Topics 3 Opacity", " Topics 3 Opacity What gives rise to the opacity observed in these complex worlds and system?
